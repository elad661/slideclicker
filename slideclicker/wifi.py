""" A simple HTTP server that allows to get a screenshot over HTTP instead of bluetooth

WARNING WARNING WARNING
Do not use this module on open/untrusted wifi networks under any circumstances
It does not use any kind of encryption, and while hmac should protect against
a common script-kiddie, it's probably not safe enough, and doesn't really
protect against DoS attacks either.

The threat model is either someone who wants to spy on your slides,
or someone who wants to screw up your talk by jamming the clicker with a DoS
attack. While both of these are unlikely, it's better to be safe than sorry."""
